# metricmapper
This repository contains code for computating the Mapper when the filter domain is included in a general metric space, with examples and applications for the space of conditional probability distributions and combinatorial graphs. Note that this code requires the modules [`sklearn_tda`](https://github.com/MathieuCarriere/sklearn-tda) and [`statmapper`](https://github.com/MathieuCarriere/statmapper) to be installed first.
